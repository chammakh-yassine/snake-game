# 🐍 Sneak Game - A Challenging Snake-like Game

Welcome to **Sneak Game**, a unique twist on the classic Snake game that’s guaranteed to test your reflexes, timing, and strategy! But beware, it’s not as easy as you think! 👾

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- **Timer-Based Gameplay**: You start with a 10-second timer, which counts down as you race to collect food. The timer resets after each food is eaten. However, it **speeds up over time**, so stay sharp!
- **Score System**: Eat food quickly for higher rewards. The score decreases the longer you take to reach the food. Miss it completely, and you’ll lose a piece of your body, affecting your overall score.
- **Food Disappears**: If you fail to reach the food before the timer runs out, it will vanish, and a new piece of food will appear elsewhere. But that’s not all – you’ll lose part of your body, making survival harder.
- **Multiple Ways to Lose**: There are several ways to lose:
  - Hit the walls 🧱
  - Hit your own body 🐍
  - Let your snake disappear entirely (lose all your body parts) ⚔️
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The snake speeds up as time passes, making the game harder with every second. Your reflexes and strategy will be put to the test.
  
## 🕹️ Controls

- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** to control the snake’s direction.
- **Hold down** the movement key to run faster temporarily.
- **Press ‘Q’** at any time to quit the game.

## 🏆 Scoring

- **Eat food quickly** to maximize your score. The sooner you reach the food, the higher your score boost.
- The score formula takes into account the size of the snake, the number of food items eaten, and the speed at which the food was consumed. Higher risk, higher reward!
- **Bonus system**: As the game speeds up, you’ll get bonus points to balance the increasing challenge.
